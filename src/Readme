Static block => used for getting the hash value i.e unique orderId
                storing all the data to the array list which can be used in entire process


Main class = > contains the main menu which has to be displayed in the screen

Order class => it is the object which is used to create and add order to the array list
               contains getter and setter methods which is used for initialising and extracting private variables
                provides security

Order Management Interface => Contains the methods which has to be implemented and provides abstraction

Implemented class => this class implements the order management interface
                     provides the logic for the interface

method overloading => viewOrder();

FileWriting=> which is used for threading concept for writing to the file using the thread
                which is used for generating report

Array list which is created initially used for all the process
    reference which is referring the array list is passed to the array list is passed for the operations


Additional Features/ Updates :
    --> Moving pointer from any running process to main menu. Also avoid incorrect option entry by user. example if user clicks on add order and then he wants to not add the order then he can directly exit from the process to main menu
                    using exit or -1
    --> After sorting the array list based on the status if there is no order present then display "NO RECORDS.." in the order report.
    -->Updating the delivery address by taking the order id by the user
    --> If the Order id is by default present as "ORD-4digits numbers " user have the permission to enter the digits to do all the operations
                for example if order id is -- "ORD-0002" then user can enter only integer value of "2" for performing any action
    --> If the order is cancelled the order delivery date should be "NA" instead of "null"
    --> The delivery date should not contain Date
    --> if the order is delivered then the Order delivery date should contain date and time also
    -->if the order Description or order delivery address is more then threshold length then while displaying the content for proper formatting
    --> including the time zone like AM/PM in the order date
    --> if the user continuously enter invalid or incorrect order id display the available order id to the user
                -- if by seeing the order id the user enter invalid order id then the pointer/cursor moved from particular method to main menu
